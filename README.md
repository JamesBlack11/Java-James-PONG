# Java-James-PONG
I Made Pong! 
It Took a while for me to get the ball to respond when I scored on the right. I enjoyed making the game. its great that everything works as it should. I had trouble with the ball responding randomly down the line. I am excited with everything I learned. getting more used to using JFrame, JPanel, and more. I am also feeling more comfortable with OOP and instantiation. all in all a quick fun project!
